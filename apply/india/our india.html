		 every corner</em> of India has its own story. Almost every state of India has one or more special Indian heritage sites which have now become the attractions of tourists. Some of the sites are so significant and ancient in world history that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has recognized them as world heritage sites.

During Satyayuga there were not many bad people. It was just like heaven on earth (Maybe 10% people were bad).

In Tretayuga, people like Raavan existed. Though not many but it was more than satyayuga (Maybe 25% people were bad).

In Dwaparayuga, Kauravas were present. It was like 50 % of the people were bad.

India never <b>invaded</b> any country in her last <strong>100000</strong> years of history. <br>
When many cultures were <i> only nomadic forest dwellers over 5000 years ago,</i> Indians established <em>Harappan culture in Sindhu Valley (Indus Valley Civilization)</em><br>
The name 'India' is derived from the <u> River Indus</u>, the valleys <ins>around which were the home of the early settlers.</ins> The <mark>Aryan worshippers</mark> referred to the river Indus as the Sindhu.<br>
The Persian invaders converted it into Hindu. The name 'Hindustan' combines Sindhu and Hindu and thus refers to the land of the Hindus.
<strike>Chess was invented in India.
